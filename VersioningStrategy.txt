Here we outline the versioning strategy for the IlRibelle app.

We neeed to upload different versions to the play store, one for each
architecture (armeabi_v7a, armeabi and x86). To differentiate we need to give
each apk a different Version Code (the Version Name can be the same). We use a
six digit version code:
	AAMMNN
where AA is a code for the architecture, MM is the major version number and NN
is the minor. Version codes are:
	40 - armeabi
	50 - armeabi_v7a
	60 - x86
	99 - all architectures
Higher version numbers take the precedence over the lower ones, in case more
packages fit the same device. That's why we use a higher number for armeabi_v7a
over armeabi. Moreover some devices with x86 CPU can run armeabi or armeabi_v7a,
so we give x86 a higher version number. The code 99 is not used at the moment,
it will in case we decide to ship all architectures in the same packages (e.g.
removing QT libraries and using Ministro). So, for example, the Version Code for
version 1.23 of the app or the armeabi architecture is:
	400123
For the moment we need to change the Version Code by hand every time we change
architecture (also remember to update the version string in the about page).
